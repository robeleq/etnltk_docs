# ETNLTK Intro

Let's discover **Ethiopian Natural Language Toolkit (etnltk)** üòä.

Objective:

- The Ethiopian Natural Language Toolkit (ETNLTK) project aimed to develop a suite of open source Natural Language Processing modules for the Ethiopian languages.

Why?

- Most of resourced languages such as English and other European countries has tools such as NLTK, SPACY, CLTK and many more that allows to perform text preprocessing, but the same history is not true for Ethiopian local languages.

Inspirations:

- The Ethiopian Natural Language Toolkit (etnltk) is built using python language and takes inspiration from `spacy` and `nltk` libraries.

## Getting Started

Get started by **Installation**.

### pip

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/etnltk.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/etnltk/)

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) version 3.6 or above:
  - We recommend that you install etnltk via pip, the Python package manager. To install, simply run.

  ```python
  pip install etnltk
  ```

### From Source

- Alternatively, you can also install from source via [etnltk](https://github.com/robikieq/etnltk) git repository, which will give you more flexibility in developing on top of etnltk. For this option, run:

  ```text
  git clone https://github.com/robikieq/etnltk.git
  
  cd etnltk
  
  pip install -e .
  ```

## Amharic: ·ä†·àõ·à≠·äõ

Take a look at **[Usage Amharic](./category/usage---amharic/)** for more.

- The language serves as the official working language of the Ethiopian federal government.
- Spoken by more than 100M people arroung the world and all over Ethiopia.
- Amharic is written left-to-right using a system that grew out of the Ge Ωez script.
- The writing system is called fid√§l (·çä·ã∞·àç) in Ethiopian Semitic languages.
