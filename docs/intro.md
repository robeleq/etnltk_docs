# ETLTK Intro

Let's discover **Ethiopian Language Toolkit (etltk)** üòä.

Objective:

- The Ethiopian Natural Language Toolkit (ETLTK) project aimed to develop a suite of open source Natural Language Processing modules for the Ethiopian languages.

Why?

- Most of resourced languages such as English and other European countries has tools such as NLTK, SPACY, CLTK and many more that allows to perform text preprocessing, but the same history is not true for Ethiopian local languages.

Inspirations:

- The Ethiopian Language Toolkit (ETLTK) is built using python language and takes inspiration from `spacy` and `nltk` libraries.

## Getting Started

Get started by **Installation**.

### pip

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/etltk.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/etltk/)

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) version 3.6 or above:
  - We recommend that you install etltk via pip, the Python package manager. To install, simply run.

  ```python
  pip install etltk
  ```

### From Source

- Alternatively, you can also install from source via [ethiopian_language_toolkit](https://github.com/robikieq/ethiopian_language_toolkit) git repository, which will give you more flexibility in developing on top of etltk. For this option, run:

  ```text
  git clone https://github.com/robikieq/ethiopian_language_toolkit.git
  
  cd ethiopian_language_toolkit
  
  pip install -e .
  ```

## Amharic: ·ä†·àõ·à≠·äõ

Take a look at **[Usage Amharic](./category/usage---amharic/)** for more.
